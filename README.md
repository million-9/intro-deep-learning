# Introduction to Deep Learning

Welcome to the **Introduction to Deep Learning** repository!  
This project contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that introduce fundamental concepts in deep learning through hands-on exercises. It‚Äôs ideal for students and self-learners looking to build intuition and practical skills with neural networks.

## üìÅ Contents

- `Exercise_LinearRegression_w_BackPropagation.ipynb`:  
  Implement linear regression from scratch with backpropagation to understand gradient descent.

- `Exercise_LinearRegression_n_BinaryClassification.ipynb`:  
  Explore binary classification using logistic regression to transition from regression to classification.

- `Exercise_Optimizers.ipynb`:  
  Compare optimization techniques like SGD, Momentum, and Adam and observe their convergence behavior.

- `Exercise_LeNet_n_Regularization.ipynb`:  
  Build a CNN based on the LeNet architecture and experiment with L1/L2 regularization.

- `execise_2D_Convolution_n_ResNet.ipynb`:  
  Learn the concept of 2D convolutions and implement a simplified ResNet to understand residual learning.
